FocusTimer
===============================================================================
A simple .NET application to run a countdown timer to help maintain focus. Set
the timer duration in the options and hit start. When the timer is up, you will
be alerted.

I made this to help me maintain focus. I set a 30 minute timer, run it, and try
to not let myself get distracted until I see the alert that my 30 minutes is up.

Eventually, I plan to add stat tracking features to show how focus has changed
over time and by day of the week.
